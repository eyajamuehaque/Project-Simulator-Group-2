## T-2: Update stock levels
The inventory displayed to customers is always accurate in real-time. This prevents the frustrating situation where customers order items that are actually out-of-stock, which in turn reduces the administrative burden of handling refunds and communicating product unavailability. Accurate stock management improves customer satisfaction and streamlines order fulfillment.
